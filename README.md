# Facebook Lead Collector - Java Application

This Java application demonstrates the process of collecting leads from a specified Facebook form using the Facebook Graph API. The collected lead data is then stored in a MySQL database for further processing or analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- MySQL Server installed and running.
- A valid access token for the Facebook Graph API to retrieve leads.
- MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver) included in your project dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Setup Database:**
   - Create a MySQL database and a table named `leads` with columns for `name`, `email`, and `phone`.

2. **Update Code:**
   - Replace the `apiUrl` variable with the URL provided by Facebook for accessing your leads.
   - Modify the `dbURL`, `username`, and `password` variables in the code to match your MySQL database credentials.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Compile and run the `FacebookLeadCollector` Java file.
   - This code makes a GET request to the specified Facebook API URL to retrieve leads and saves the collected lead data into the MySQL database.

4. **Important Notes:**
   - Ensure your MySQL server is running before executing the application.
   - Adjust the code according to the response structure received from the Facebook API for lead data retrieval.
   - Always handle sensitive information like database credentials and access tokens securely.

## Further Enhancements

- Error handling and logging can be improved for better application robustness.
- Extend functionality to handle various API response structures and handle data accordingly.
- Implement authentication mechanisms and security measures for sensitive data handling.
